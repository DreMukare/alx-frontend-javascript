# 0x01. ES6 Promises

The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

A Promise is in one of these states:

- pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
- fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
- rejected: meaning that the operation failed.

This directory covers the following:

- Promises (how, why, and what)
- How to use the then, resolve, catch methods
- How to use every method of the Promise object
- Throw / Try
